							<h2>Zumba club</h2>
							<p>I got the chance to lead LCC Zumba club in 2020. The experience 
							of being one of the leaders with 3 other girls is amazing. I definitely recommend dancing zumba regularly 
							at least once a week - you will feel refreshed and full of energy.</p>

							<p> In the autumn of 2019, I joined the team of IUC as a reporter. We are a group of communication students 
							who want to perceive the path of journalism. Our goal is to establish a strong sense of community
							by delivering the news in which all readers can get involved with and share.

							<h2>Video production passion</h2>
							<p>In the fall of 2019,I took the class on Video Production as it's mandatory for my major. I've never expected that 
							I would gain so much knowledge and adore filming after that. We created 3 major projects with my team and I'm not planning to stop.
							I want to continue filming inside and outside of the university and take Advanced Video Production next year
							for improving my skills.
